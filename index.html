         <P>Divided by scientists into six geographical subspecies across its broad range, the spectacled owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata) is the only owl species known to permanently inhabit the  rainforests of the Amazon basin. It is named for the white feather markings clearly visible on its dark-feathered face, which partially encircle the eyes and extend downwards as far as the bird’s cheeks. It has a rounded head and no ear tufts, and its eyes are a bright yellow-orange. Its upper parts are dark brown, while its breast and belly are pale yellow.
          The larger great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) has been known to venture into rainforest habitats, but only rarely, and it therefore cannot be described as a true rainforest owl

          Endemic to the Neotropics, the spectacled owl’s range extends from Mexico down through the Americas as far as northwest Argentina. Across its range, the spectacled owl’s preferred habitat isdense primary lowland rainforest, and they tend not to venture into higher subtropical montane forest. Spectacled owls only tend to stray into sparser secondary forest when hunting, and are only seen rarely in more open habitats, such as savannah or dry forests<a href =" https://www.tambopatalodge.com/en/jungle-blog/spectacled-owl-the-only-owl-found-in-the-amazon-forest">Read more..</a></p>

    <P>Hummingbirds may be tiny, but they are truly mighty. The hummingbird is one of the most fascinating bird species on the planet. While it’s pretty unlikely you’ll see one up close in the wild in the UK, there’s much to learn about and plenty for you to be fascinated by if you ever get the chance to see them elsewhere around the globe.
  To start things off for you, we’ve set up a bumper stack of interesting facts about hummingbirds to act as a bit of an introduction. Perky and plucky, the hummingbird has more up its feathery wings than you might anticipate. Let’s dive in and take a closer look.<a href="https://factcity.com/facts-about-hummingbirds/" >Read more... </a></div></p>

        <p>The indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) is a small seed-eating bird in the cardinal family, Cardinalidae. It is migratory, ranging from southern Canada to northern Florida during the breeding season, and from southern Florida to northern South America during the winter.[2] It often migrates by night, using the stars to navigate.[3] Its habitat is farmland, brush areas, and open woodland.[4] The indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlapThe indigo bunting is a small bird, with a length of 11.5–13 cm (4.5–5.1 in). It displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is vibrant blue in the summer, with brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate. It is brown during the winter months, while the female is brown year-round. Nest-building and incubation are done solely by the female. The diet of the indigo bunting consists primarily of insects during the summer months and seeds during the winter months<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_bunting" >Read more....</a>

          <p>Flamingos are one of the most ancient species of bird still living. Their bright colors and plumage along with their odd feeding habits distinguish them from other tropical species.A staple of zoos across the world, wild flamingos can be found in tropical and temperate regions near bodies of water and often near rainforests.Flamingos can be found living in tropical and temperate regions of Africa, the Mediterranean region, India, Caribbean coasts, the highlands of the Andes in South America and on the Galapagos Islands. The six types of flamingos -- Caribbean, greater, Chilean, lesser, Andean and James' -- congregate near shallow salt lakes or lagoons, whether it is near the coast, connected to the sea or far inland. Lesser flamingos can even live in volcanic soda lakes, which are considered inhospitable to most animal life.
          Diet and Feeding.
         In the rainforest, flamingos feast primarily on algae or invertebrates, such as mollusks. Flamingos' long legs allow them to tread into deeper water in search of food. To find a meal, a flamingo dips its bill upside down under the water and sucks both water and mud through the front and then gushes any unwanted particles out the sides. According to the San Diego Zoo, the bird's lamellae, which are briny plates on the sides of the bill, act as a filter to keep the edible portions in the bill. The food flamingos eat, such as shrimp and blue-green algae, are what give it the bright pink, red and orange colors<a href="https://getawaytips.azcentral.com/flamingos-in-the-rainforest-12559235.html"> Read more...</a> </p>

       <p>The bald eagle, with its snowy-feathered (not bald) head and white tail, is the proud national bird symbol of the United States—yet the bird was nearly wiped out there. For many decades, bald eagles were hunted for sport and for the "protection" of fishing grounds. Pesticides like DDT also wreaked havoc on eagles and other birds. These chemicals collect in fish, which make up most of the eagle's diet. They weaken the bird's eggshells and severely limited their ability to reproduce. Since DDT use was heavily restricted in 1972, eagle numbers have rebounded significantly and have been aided by reintroduction programs. The result is a wildlife success story—the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has upgraded the birds from endangered to least concern.

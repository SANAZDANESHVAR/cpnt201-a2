### Help and guidness
 Patrick teach me how ican link html pages to  the css in order to run  the projrct.
 
 ### weakness point
 ### the sm version(B&W version) dose not work
1)In this project i used different images for different screen size also use SIZE to define special size and condition. it was supposed to see all imagees in black and white in mobile devices but  it shown as the full color version(like lrg files).
2) the second point is about inspection . when I use inspect element Q and try different size of screen I can  lrg and md and still sm dose not work. resizing window follows this pattern as well.
